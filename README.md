# OLEKit

Swift support for Microsoft OLE2 format, also known as Structured Storage, [Compound File Binary Format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compound_File_Binary_Format) or Compound Document File Format.

Some of the file formats that utilize it:

- Encrypted Office Open XML documents (Microsoft Office 2003+, Word `.docx`, Excel `.xlsx`, PowerPoint `.pptx`)
- Microsoft Office 97-2003 documents ([BIFF5 and later](https://www.gaia-gis.it/gaia-sins/freexl-1.0.5-doxy-doc/html/Format.html) in Word `.doc`, Excel `.xls`, PowerPoint `.ppt`, Visio `.vsd`, Project `.mpp`)
- `vbaProject.bin` in MS Office 2007+ files
- Image Composer and FlashPix files
- Outlook messages
- StickyNotes
- Zeiss AxioVision ZVI files
- Olympus FluoView OIB files
- McAfee antivirus quarantine files
- Hancom Word's `.hwp` file format

...and more. If you know of a file format that is based on CFBF, please submit [a pull request](https://github.com/MaxDesiatov/OLEKit/edit/master/README.md) so that it's added to the list.

Automatically generated documentation is available on [our GitHub Pages](https://coreoffice.github.io/OLEKit/).

## Example

An OLE2 file has [a minuature filesystem embedded in
it](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compound_File_Binary_Format#Structure) that is
represented as a tree of
[`DirectoryEntry`](https://github.com/CoreOffice/OLEKit/blob/master/Sources/OLEKit/DirectoryEntry.swift)
values in OLEKit.

To read a file and an entry within the file:

1. Add `import OLEKit` at the top of a relevant source file.
2. Use `OLEFile(_ path: String)` to create a new instance with a path to your OLE2 file.
3. Use the `root` property of type `DirectoryEntry` on `OLEFile` to read the root
   directory entry, and the `children` property on `DirectoryEntry` to traverse the tree of
   entries.
4. Call `stream(_ entry:)` on your `OLEFile` instance to get access to the entry.
   This returns an instance of `DataReader` that provides helper `read()` functions
   for reading raw data.

```swift
import OLEKit

let filepath = "./categories.xlsx"
let entryName = "EncryptionInfo"

let ole = try OLEFile(filepath)
guard
  let infoEntry = oleFile.root.children.first(where: { $0.name == entryName })
else { fatalError("entry \(entryName) not found in file \(filepath)") }

let stream = try oleFile.stream(infoEntry)

// Read version bytes from the encryption stream in little-endian order
let major: UInt16 = stream.read()
let minor: UInt16 = stream.read()

guard major == 4 && minor == 4
else { fatalError("unknown version: major \(major), minor \(minor)") }

// change position in the `stream`
reader.seek(toOffset: 8)
// get the rest of the data
let rawStreamData = reader.readDataToEnd()
```

library](https://github.com/CoreOffice/CryptoOffice/blob/3198d5e5add53fab66289a45f9f1760e360bac36/Sources/CryptoOffice/CryptoOfficeFile.swift#L28)
for a more detailed example.

## Requirements

**Apple Platforms**

- Xcode 11.0 or later
- Swift 5.1 or later

**Linux**

- Swift 5.1 or later

## Installation

### Swift Package Manager

[Swift Package Manager](https://swift.org/package-manager/) is a tool for
managing the distribution of Swift code. Itâ€™s integrated with the Swift build
system to automate the process of downloading, compiling, and linking
dependencies on all platforms.

Once you have your Swift package set up, adding `OLEKit` as a dependency is as
easy as adding it to the `dependencies` value of your `Package.swift`.

```swift
dependencies: [
  .package(
    url: "https://github.com/CoreOffice/OLEKit.git",
    .upToNextMinor(from: "0.2.0")
  )
]
```

If you're using OLEKit in an app built with Xcode, you can also add it as a direct
dependency [using Xcode's
GUI](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/adding_package_dependencies_to_your_app).

## Contributing

### Sponsorship

If this library saved you any amount of time or money, please consider [sponsoring
the work of its maintainer](https://github.com/sponsors/MaxDesiatov). While some of the
sponsorship tiers give you priority support or even consulting time, any amount is
appreciated and helps in maintaining the project.

### Coding Style

This project uses [SwiftFormat](https://github.com/nicklockwood/SwiftFormat)
and [SwiftLint](https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint) to
enforce formatting and coding style. We encourage you to run SwiftFormat within
a local clone of the repository in whatever way works best for you either
manually or automatically via an [Xcode
extension](https://github.com/nicklockwood/SwiftFormat#xcode-source-editor-extension),
[build phase](https://github.com/nicklockwood/SwiftFormat#xcode-build-phase) or
[git pre-commit
hook](https://github.com/nicklockwood/SwiftFormat#git-pre-commit-hook) etc.

To guarantee that these tools run before you commit your changes on macOS, you're encouraged
to run this once to set up the [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) hook:

```
brew bundle # installs SwiftLint, SwiftFormat and pre-commit
pre-commit install # installs pre-commit hook to run checks before you commit
```

Refer to [the pre-commit documentation page](https://pre-commit.com/) for more details
and installation instructions for other platforms.

SwiftFormat and SwiftLint also run on CI for every PR and thus a CI build can
fail with incosistent formatting or style. We require CI builds to pass for all
PRs before merging.
